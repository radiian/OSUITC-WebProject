#INSTALLER
This folder contains the installer.
The installer is responsible for the initial setup of the database and populating basic configuration data in it.
It is a self contained application that should not rely on any part of the rest of the project.
All configuration that may be required during installation should be done via the installer's web UI.
No manual configuration should be required by the user during installation.
