					<h4>An official post</h4>
					<p>This is the content of some sort of important announcement! This area will hold several of these kinds of announcements for users to see when they first access the web site. This could be anything from meeting announcements, to other information about what's going on in the club. These announcements can be stuck to the front page so they are always displayed, or left to display in a blog style so that newer posts show up on top of older posts.
					</p>
				</section>

				<section id="main-content">
					<h4>Another post</h4>
					<p>This is some other kind of content. This could be about anything at all regarding the club and what's going on. These announcements would be generated by some sort of kitchen sink WYSIWYG editor that only specific groups or roles could access.
					<p>
				</section>

				<section id="main-content">
					<h4>Again a post</h4>
					<p>And here is another kind of thing. These are here just to fill up the page a bit to give a feeling for how this may actually look if it were a real website. But since it's not, these are just bogus information really.
